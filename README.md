This mod lets you create saves beyond the original three by selecting "New Save" and hosting a game.

It reorganizes your saves at every opportunity, so you might notice your existing saves getting shuffled around.

I recommend backing up any precious saves you might have before installing this mod.

Right now the UI is a little bit silly, this is an early version, please be nice. :) If you notice any bugs beyond UI weirdness, feel free to DM me (@poobsie) on Discord.
